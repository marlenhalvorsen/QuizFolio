# Quizfolio

This repository is a learning project to practice Java by building a small app that cleans up notes and generates quiz questions via an AI port — using Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters).

## Goals
- Explore Java basics by building something concrete.
- Apply Hexagonal Architecture (separating core/application from adapters).
- Practice dependency inversion, single responsibility, and separation of concerns.
- Keep it framework-free and simple.

## Status
Work in progress – learning playground, not a finished product.
